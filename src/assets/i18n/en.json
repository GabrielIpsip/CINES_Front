The law relating to the Liberties and Responsibilities of Universities (LRU) and then decree 2011-996 dated August 23rd 2011 paved the way for thought about how this survey should evolve. Work on simplifying and modernizing the survey began in 2011 with the participation of the evaluation and steering committee of the French Academic Libraries' Directors' Association (ADBU), the Association of Scientific and Technical Information Officers of French Research Organizations (EPRIST) and the French General Inspectorate of Libraries (IGB).",
